# Netless-Basketball-Detector
This idea was inspired by the basketball courts typically located in smaller communities that do not have the funds to maintain the courts. These courts tend to be built and rarely repaired which leads to their basketball hoop deteriorating over time. The first part to typically get destroyed is the net, and in basketball games the net acts as a verification that the ball was scored

To address this issue, I intend to create a device that will act as a ball sensor. This device will be placed on the basketball hoop next to the blackboard and wait until a ball gets into the hoop. Once the sensor detects the ball, it will flash an LED for a few seconds, make a sound for the same amount of time, and increment a counter which will be displayed on a screen so that the players will be able to verify that a point was scored and not have to rely on their guesswork.

Construction instructions:
Chassis:
Measure the dimensions of all of the hardware, to select a box large enough to house everything. Once you have your box, determine where you would like to have the inputs and outputs show.
Note: both sensors should face in the same directions and should be located on top of each other. Once the locations have been chosen, mark on the box where cuts would have to be made, measure twice, cut once. At the end, you should have a box with various holes cut into it. Now place your input and output in their corresponding holes.

Use:
To use the device, you first need to load the program onto the arduino. To do so, connect the arduino to your computer and within the arduino IDE and upload the program. Once uploaded you will be be able to run the program and use the device.
